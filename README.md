# Python-Projects-Task1-4
"This project includes 4 tasks in which the user inputs numbers and the program performs various calculations. The tasks include computing the sum of three numbers, prompting the user to input two numbers and computing their product, computing the maximum of five numbers, and creating a character for a fantasy game using user inputs with Python.

### Task 1
​
- Write a program which asks the user for three numbers and prints the sum of those numbers
​
Example output:
​
```
$ sh sum.py
Enter number: 200
Enter number: 500
Enter number: 300
Sum of the numbers: 1000
```
​
### Task 2
​
- Write a program that asks the user for two numbers
- If the number1 is greater than number2, print "First number is greater!"
- If the number2 is greater than number1, print "Second number is greater!"
- If the number1 is equal to number2, print "Numbers are equal!"
- If both numbers are greater than 10000, print "Numbers are beeeeeeg!"
    - *HELPING HINT*:
​
    ```py
        if (expression1) and (expression2):
            print(stuff)
    ```
​
### Task 3
​
- Write a program which asks the user for five numbers and prints the largest of those numbers.
​
Example output:
​
```
$ sh max.py
Enter number: 50
Enter number: 680
Enter number: 7
Enter number: 1030
Enter number: -4 
Maximum of the numbers: 1030
```
​
### Task 4
​
- Your task is to write a Python program to asks for a month name and prints the number of days in that month.
​
Example output:

```
​
### Task 5
